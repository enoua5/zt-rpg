      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        This is an RPG system designed to work with the Zheilao Teiga
        multiverse, with specific rules crafted to reflect the magic and themes
        of that setting. The universes within the multiverse, however, are
        diverse enough that many settings could work. This rule-set outlines the
        rules that are consistent throughout that multiverse.
      </p>
      <p>
        This rules document assumes basic familiarity with table-top
        role-playing games. There will be references to things such as GMs,
        player characters, and various types of dice without explicit
        explanation.
      </p>
      <h2>General rules to keep in mind</h2>
      <p>
        The following are general rules about the game that are good to keep in
        mind before getting into the specifics. Some of this is just normal
        TTRPG advice, some of it is clarifications about the system.
      </p>
      <h3>Running the game</h3>
      <h4>Respect</h4>
      <p>
        Different players can have wildly different ideas for how a TTRPG is
        supposed to go, and what things are or are not fun. Make sure to have an
        honest conversation with each other before the game begins, and maintain
        an environment that encourages further conversation as needed.
      </p>
      <h4>The GM's role</h4>
      <p>
        The GM is not the enemy of the players, and shouldn't be trying to kill
        the player characters. Work together to create a story. If that story
        would be improved by the death of a player character, then it can
        definitely happen. Again, this is something to discuss before getting
        too far into.
      </p>
      <h4>Specificity</h4>
      <p>
        Sometimes a rule will overrule another. Specific rules, such as from
        Feats, always overrule more general rules.
      </p>
      <h4>This is a beta</h4>
      <p>
        This RPG isn't quite as finished as others you may be used to. There may
        be glaring issues, and broken exploits. If there's something getting in
        the way of the fun of the game, go ahead and change it, as long as you
        can agree with each other on the change. There's no sanctity in the
        rules.
      </p>
      <h3>Dice and numbers</h3>
      <h4>Exploding dice</h4>
      <p>
        All dice in this system explode. If you're unfamiliar with this
        mechanic, it means if a die rolls its maximum value, you may roll
        another of the same type and add on its value to the roll. Here
        specifically, dice are recursively exploding, so if the extra die you
        roll for the explosion also rolls its maximum value, it also explodes.
      </p>
      <h4>Rounding</h4>
      <p>
        At some points you will be halving numbers, or otherwise arriving at
        fractional values. In this system, always round down to the nearest
        whole number.
      </p>
      <h4>Negative numbers</h4>
      <p>
        This system is generally more comfortable with negative numbers than
        most systems, allowing you to have negative HP for instance. One
        potentially surprising aspect this may come up is when rolling for
        damage or healing. If a strong negative adjustment is applied to a low
        roll, you can easily end up with negative damage or healing. If this
        occurs, negative healing
        <em>does</em> lower HP and negative damage <em>does</em> increase it.
        You can think of it as botching a medicine attempt, having a rough
        night's sleep, or missing an attack so badly it reinvigorates your
        target. To be clear, I mostly put this in the game because I think it's
        funny.
