      <h1>Additional Rules</h1>
      <h2 id="cover">Cover</h2>
      <p>
        If a Target is at least half concealed from an Attack or anything that
        Targets it, it has Cover. If the Target is only partially concealed it
        has Partial Cover, and Checks made to Target it are made with an
        Adjustment of -3. If it is completely concealed it has Full Cover, and
        it cannot be Targeted directly. Cover is symmetrical, if one character
        is Covered from another, the other has the same level of Cover from the
        first.
      </p>
      <h2 id="damage-type">Damage Types</h2>
      <p>
        Usually Damage is simply dealt, and the nature of the Damage is
        irrelevant. However, there may be certain Feats that specify resistance,
        vulnerability, or even immunity to certain Damage Types. For that
        reason, those Damage Types are listed here. Resistance halves the damage
        taken, Vulnerability doubles it, and Immunity prevents any damage from
        being taken.
      </p>
      <h3 id="standard-dmg">Standard</h3>
      <p>
        Standard Damage is the type dealt by default. If a source does not
        specify a Damage Type, it's Standard Damage. This encompasses both
        bludgeoning and sharp damages.
      </p>
      <h3>Mental</h3>
      <p>
        While not literal physical damage, Mental Damage is Damage dealt to a
        character's willpower, and can take down a character nonetheless.
        Associated with Will Saves.
      </p>
      <h3>Poison</h3>
      <p>
        Damage dealt by poisons and other toxic sources, as well as acids.
        Usually associated with Resilience Saves.
      </p>
      <h3>Elemental</h3>
      <p>
        Most of the
        <a href="magic.html#twelve-elements">twelve elements</a>
        can deal damage in some way. Each of these is counted as a separate
        damage type.
      </p>
      <h2 id="falling">Fall Damage</h2>
      <p>
        If a character falls a distance exceeding 5 meters, they will take Fall
        Damage. For every 5 meters fallen, they take 2d6 Damage.
      </p>
      <h2 id="fire">Fire Damage/Spread</h2>
      <p>
        Note, this section uses the
        <a href="magic.html#emu">EMU</a>
        as a unit, which is described in the Elemental Magic section. EMUs work
        slightly differently with fire compared to the other Elements. Instead
        of EMU measuring just the space taken up by the flame, it also measures
        its heat. A normal fire covering two spaces is 2 EMU like normal, but a
        twice-as-hot flame covering just one space is also 2 EMU.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fire inflicts damage upon contact with a character. Damage dealt is 1d6
        with an Adjustment equal to the EMU value of the flame, either at the
        start of the character's turn, or when the character enters the flame,
        but only once per Round.
      </p>
      <p>
        A flame will naturally gain or lose EMUs once per Round to match its
        fuel source, as well as spread &mdash; if a Caster created the flame,
        this happens at the <em>start</em> of that Caster's Turns, otherwise it
        happens at the start of Initiative Order. If the fuel source has a
        greater potential than the flame is using, the flame gains 1 EMU per
        Round. If the fuel source has a lesser potential than the flame is
        using, the flame instantly drops to match the fuel's potential once per
        Round. If the flame is adjacent to a non-burning fuel source (and not
        prevented from spreading), it will add 1 EMU of flame to all spaces in
        the cardinal (up, down, left, right) directions.
      </p>
      <h2 id="resting">Resting</h2>
      <p>
        Characters can recuperate through Resting. To Rest, the characters must
        spend two hours doing minimal activity, such as sleeping or tending to
        wounds. Once a character has successfully completed a Rest, they may
        make a Check using Resiliency, Will, or Spirit, and heal that amount.
        For longer rests, feel free to roll all the dice together at the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a character spends 3 Rests (totaling 6 hours)
        <a href="magic.html#unconscious">Unconscious</a>
        within a 12 hour period, it is counted as Sleep in addition to Rest.
        When they complete Sleep, they can reduce their Fatigue level by 1, and
        reset their Energy its Max. Note that Sleep does not automatically reset HP to
        max. Rest Healing is only granted via the Checks made for every two
        hours of Rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The quality of your sleeping conditions can give you an Adjustment to
        your Healing Check, ranging from -5 for the least comfortable and most
        dangerous places, to +5 for the most comfortable bed in a peaceful
        place. If the result of the Healing Check is negative, you
        <em>do</em> take damage. If rolling the dice for multiple Healing Checks at once,
        make sure to apply the Adjustment multiple times to match.
