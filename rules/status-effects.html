      <h1>Appendix A — Status Effects</h1>
      <h2>Blinded/Deafened</h2>
      <p>
        When a character is Blinded or Deafened, they automatically fail any
        Check that requires that sense. If a character is Blinded, all Saves
        they make against Attacks are made with Adjustment of -3, and all
        Attacks they make are also made with Adjustment of -3. Being in an area
        with no light counts as being Blinded.
      </p>
      <h2 id="fatigue">Fatigue</h2>
      <p>
        Fatigue is a measure of how worn-out a character is. Fatigue can range
        from one to six, with higher numbers being more exhausted. Characters
        can get a level of Fatigue either from performing strenuous activity for
        an extended period of time (as determined by the GM), or by going 24
        hours without Sleep. The following effects apply depending on your level
        of Fatigue. Each level also gives the effects of all lower levels:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>-3 Adjustment on all Checks (but not Saves) except to Attack</li>
        <li>Speed halved</li>
        <li>-3 Adjustment on all Saves and to Attacks</li>
        <li>Hit Points and Energy are capped at half of Max HP</li>
        <li>Character falls Unconscious</li>
        <li>Character dies</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="grappled">Grappled</h2>
      <p>
        A grappled character cannot move on their own, and is instead forced to
        move with whatever is grappling them. They have -3 Adjustment on all
        Checks and Saves made with abilities in the Body Category.
      </p>
      <h2 id="hunger">Hungry</h2>
      <p>
        When a character goes 12 hours without eating, they get Hungry. When
        Hungry, they cannot gain the benefits of Sleep. This includes resetting
        how long it has been since they last Slept, and so they will start
        gaining levels of Fatigue every 24 hours, even if they are trying to
        sleep. Rest Healing Checks also gain an additional -5 Adjustment.
      </p>
      <h2>Incapacitated</h2>
      <p>
        A character is Incapacitated if they are restrained or otherwise
        incapable of acting on their own accord. While Incapacitated, they
        cannot take any Movement and may be limited on what Actions they can
        take. If the situation can be resisted, they can use a Major Action to
        make an appropriate Check, ending the Incapacitated Condition on a
        success.
      </p>
      <h2>Poisoned</h2>
      <p>
        While poisoned, a character has -3 Adjustment on all Checks. Specific
        poisons may have other effects, such as recurring damage, or blindness.
      </p>
      <h2>Prone</h2>
      <p>
        A character is Prone if they are laying on the ground. They can crawl at
        half their base Speed, and can use 4 meters of Movement to stand up.
        While Prone, they have -3 Adjustment on all Melee Attacks. Melee Attacks
        against them have +3 Adjustment, and Ranged Attacks have -3 Adjustment.
      </p>
      <h2 id="unconscious">Unconscious</h2>
      <p>
        Unconsciousness usually occurs when a character's Hit Points drop to or
        below zero or when sleeping. However, shorter unconsciousness may occur
        at GM discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Unconscious, a character is Incapacitated. They cannot communicate
        or use any of their senses. All Saves they make&mdash; with the
        exception of Spirit and Resilience Checks&mdash; result in a zero, plus
        any Adjustments. Unconsciousness counts as sleeping for the purposes of
        <a href="additional.html#resting">Resting</a>.
