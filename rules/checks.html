      <h1>Ability Checks</h1>
      <p>
        When a character attempts to do something that could potentially fail,
        or when a character is in immediate danger, the GM can have that
        character make an Ability Check. The GM will choose a relevant Ability
        and a Difficulty. The player controlling the character (or the GM if the
        character is an NPC) then rolls dice based on their score for that
        Ability (<a href="#dice-table">see the table below</a>). Any dice that
        roll their maximum value explode, potentially several times, adding to
        the total each time. After the dice are rolled, they add relevant
        Adjustments (if applicable) and call out the total. If the total is
        equal to or higher than the Difficulty, the character succeeds,
        otherwise they fail. Failures should generally put the character into a
        worse situation than before the roll, depending on the perilousness of
        the attempted action.
      </p>
      <h3>Adjustments</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes you will be given Adjustments to Checks, be it through Feats,
        Items, or even just the GM's ruling on the circumstances. These
        Adjustments can be positive or negative, and are added onto the relevant
        Check.
      </p>
      <h3>Added and Removed Dice</h3>
      <p>
        Another way Ability Checks may be modified is through Added and Removed
        dice. For any particular Ability Score, the dice used for Checks are all
        of the same type. If you are instructed to Remove dice, make the Check
        with one less of the die type, and for Added dice add another of the
        same type. If all the dice used for a Check are Removed, treat the Check
        as though the dice rolled a zero.
      </p>
      <h3>Contested Checks</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes a character will make an action in direct opposition to
        another character. In this case, the GM does <em>not</em> decide the
        Difficulty, Instead, the opposing character makes a type of Check called
        a Save, that acts as the Difficulty. The Save must be made using an
        Ability that could reasonably oppose the action. In a tie, a Save beats
        a Check. If the GM determines that one character has a significant
        advantage over the other due to circumstance rather than ability, they
        may award one character a positive Adjustment to the roll.
      </p>
      <h3>"Take Score" Option</h3>
      <p>
        When a Check is needed for a character to perform a routine or otherwise
        non-perilous action, the player may choose to use their Ability Score
        plus three in place of their dice roll. This <em>cannot</em> be used in
        any situation involving Combat, Contests, nor any perilous or intense
        situations.
      </p>
      <h3>Critical Failure</h3>
      <p>
        If all dice used for a check result in ones, then the Check is a
        Critical Failure. This causes the Check to fail regardless of Difficulty
        or Adjustments. If a Contested Check results in both parties having
        Critical Failure, the Save beats the Check, even if the Check had a
        higher Adjustment.
