      <h1>Character Creation</h1>
      <p>
        At the heart of any RPG system is the characters; each player will need
        to make one. In contrast to what is commonly seen in other RPG systems,
        ZT has no character classes or races. Instead, all abilities and Feats
        are open for players to purchase with
        <a href="#skill-points">Skill Points</a>. Instead of choosing races and
        classes, players are encouraged to choose Abilities and Feats that
        describe that character. For example, if playing a character with wings
        (a bird, angel, etc), they may want to take the Flying Feat.
      </p>
      <h2>Character Description</h2>
      <p>
        As the first step to creating a character, you should get an idea of who
        your character is. Only after doing should you move on to choosing
        stats. For each of the categories below, describe at least two different
        attributes.
      </p>
      <h3>Physical Appearance</h3>
      <p>
        Describe how your character looks. Consider attributes such as their
        age, race, gender expression, build, clothing, complexion, and any
        features that stand out. Choose at least one thing that can readily be
        observed about your character upon first impressions, and at least one
        thing that can be observed upon closer inspection or interaction.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h3>Personality</h3>
      <p>
        Describe how your character generally acts. Are they cheerful or
        pessimistic? Do they make friends everywhere they go or are they slow to
        trust? Do they have any particular quirks that affect their decisions
        and interactions? Pick at least two attributes: one that would be clear
        within the first few minutes of interacting with them, and one that
        would become apparent over days or weeks of interaction.
      </p>
      <h3>Ideals</h3>
      <p>
        Describe what your character holds as important - what motivates them.
        This can be anything from &ldquo;helping others&rdquo; to
        &ldquo;money&rdquo; or anything else that could motivate your character
        to potentially risk their life on the adventure. Pick at least two
        ideals: one that they would state outright if asked why they adventure;
        and a second personal one that may not be outright stated, but still
        influences their decisions.
      </p>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        Describe some important events from your character&rsquo;s past. These
        are events that changed the course of their lives and continue to
        influence their decisions. You can include things such as family, home
        town, and other pieces of background information. Describe at least two
        distinct events.
      </p>
      <h2 id="skill-points">Skill Points</h2>
      <p>
        Skill Points are the fundamental unit for creating and improving a
        character on a mechanical level. They can be spent to increase Ability
        Scores and to unlock new Feats, or can be saved up to purchase bigger
        Feats later.
      </p>
      <h3>Gaining Skill Points</h3>
      <p>
        When creating a new character, you get 8 Skill Points. You can
        immediately spend these to create your character, though you may choose
        to save some in reserve if you so choose.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will gain more skill points throughout gameplay. The GM is to give
        players Skill Points for various accomplishments throughout the
        campaign. Skill Points can be both given and spent mid-session. It is
        recommended that the GM give each player about 4 Skill Points to each
        player in each session, and to distribute them between players evenly.
        However, the GM is free to bend these recommendations to control the
        speed at which characters gain skill and to incentivise different
        things.
      </p>
      <h3>Spending Skill Points</h3>
      <p>
        At any time, you can choose to spend your Skill Points on Feats or
        Ability Scores. Feats will grant you special options to use, whereas
        Ability Scores will increase your general skills. To purchase something,
        you must have enough Skill Points to meet its cost, and you then lose
        those Skill Points. You can <em>not</em> refund Skill Points.
      </p>
      <h4>Feats</h4>
      <p>
        In
        <a href="feats.html">Appendix D</a>, there is a list of Feats. Each Feat
        consists of a description, a cost, and potentially some prerequisites.
        The description details the abilities gained by taking the feat, The
        cost is how many Skill Points it takes to gain that Feat, and the
        prerequisites are the conditions that must be met before taking the
        Feat.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the
        <a href="feats.html#swimming">Swimming</a>
        Feat costs 1 Skill Point, and is described as giving you the ability to
        move through water at your base Speed. And so, after spending 1 Skill
        Point on the Feat, your character gains the ability to swim just as fast
        as they can walk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that because all Feats are open to every player, you may
        technically be able to purchase Feats that make no sense narratively.
        The GM may require you to explain why your character is now able to use
        this Feat before you can purchase it.
      </p>
      <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
      <p>
        There are 12 Abilities divided into 3 Categories. Each Ability has a
        score, with higher scores representing more skill with that ability.
        These scores control which dice are rolled for
        <a href="checks.html">Ability Checks</a>, as well as some factoring into
        other stats and abilities, such as health. All Ability Scores start at
        0.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can spend Skill Points to improve any of the three Skill Categories.
        For each Skill Point spent on a Category, choose one Ability Score in
        that Category to increase by 2, and a different skill in the same
        Category to increase by 1. The Categories and Abilities are detailed
        below. The examples given for each Ability is not meant to represent a
        complete list of what that Ability can be used for, rather it is to
        provide explanatory examples of situations where the Ability could be
        relevant.

      <h2>Other Stats</h2>
      <p>
        After you have spent your skill points on Abilities and Feats, there are
        a few other stats you need to add. Make sure to come back to this list
        to update these stats as you improve your Abilities later:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li id="max-hp">
          <strong>Maximum Hit Points (Max HP):</strong> this is how many Hit
          Points you can have at once. Value is equal to the sum of your
          Resilience, Will, and Spirit scores, multiplied by 2, and then plus
          20. Some Feats may boost this further.
        </li>
        <li id="hp">
          <strong>Hit Points (HP):</strong> this is how much more damage you can
          take before falling unconscious. Starting value is equal to Max HP.
          This value is <em>not</em> automatically updated as you level up the
          relevant Ability Scores, and can only be increased through Healing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Soul Energy (Energy):</strong> this is how much more Energy
          you can channel through your soul before needing to Rest. Starting
          value, as well as maximum value, is equal to your Max HP.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Speed:</strong> this is how many meters you can walk in one
          Turn. Value is equal to half your Athletics Score (rounded down), plus
          8.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Size:</strong> There are five Size Classes: &frac12;, 1, 2, 3,
          and 4. Your size indicates the side length in meters of the space that
          your character can occupy in combat. Unless your GM allows otherwise,
          your size is 1.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Starting Equipment</h2>
      <p>
        When creating a character, you get 100
        <a href="equipment.html#credits">Credits</a>
        to spend on
        <a href="equipment.html">Equipment</a>. You may pick items from the Equipment
        section to add to your inventory, subtracting their cost from your
        Credit total. You do not need to spend all your Credits during character
        creation.
      </p>
