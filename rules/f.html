      <h1>Appendix F — Enemies</h1>
      <p>
        This section is only really necessary to read as a GM, though if you're
        another player, you won't find any sort of "spoilers" by choosing to
        read it, and may even find some inspirations for builds in the "minions"
        section. As a GM, you will need to provide enemies for your players to
        fight. These enemies come in two basic types: detailed enemies and
        minions. These enemies also have a Difficulty Rating, which can help
        guide the GM in balancing encounters. Note that despite this section
        being called "enemies", any allies the players may have are created
        using the same rules.
      </p>
      <h2>Difficulty Ratings</h2>
      <p>
        Each combatant in an encounter will have a Difficulty Rating, including
        the players. The player's Difficulty Rating is the total number of Skill
        Points they have. An enemy's Difficulty Rating will be mentioned in the
        section discussing that enemy type.
      </p>
      <p>
        When determining the difficulty for a fight, organize the combatants
        into two sides: the players and their allies, and those hostile to them.
        Each side will have a Total Difficulty Rating determined by the sums of
        the Difficulty Ratings of their combatants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difficulty for the players of a fight can be estimated by comparing
        the two Total Difficulty Rating. If the two are equal, expect a rather
        tough fight, where the two sides have roughly equal odds of winning. For
        easier or harder fights, simply shift this balance one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also note that there are other factors that affect encounter difficulty
        which aren't accounted for with the raw Difficulty Ratings. Encounter
        rate is highly important, especially given the potentially slow rate of
        health recovery: what might be a hard fight at full preparedness could
        turn deadly if the player characters haven't had time to recover.
        Another thing to consider is the encounter goal. A fight to the death
        could easily lead to deaths on both sides, even if the players have a
        decent advantage. However, not all fights have to be to the death. You
        may consider creating situations where players are trying to drive
        enemies out of an area without needing to kill them, or stop enemies
        from stealing an artifact, or assassinate an important character. If you
        create situations where non-lethal solutions are encouraged and
        rewarded, you may be able to run more difficult encounters than you
        might otherwise have been able to.
      </p>
      <h2>Detailed Enemies</h2>
      <p>
        Detailed enemies are used especially for notable figures the players
        will fight. You should choose to create a detailed enemy if the enemy is
        a proper character in their own right, or is the centerpiece of a
        particularly difficult or important encounter.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create a detailed character, simply follow the same guide you would
        for
        <a href="charcreate.html">creating a player character</a>. You may also
        choose
        <a href="#enemy-feats">enemy-only feats</a>
        when creating the character. The character's Difficulty Rating is equal
        to their Skill Points.
      </p>
      <h2>Minions</h2>
      <p>
        Minions tend to be less important enemies, either helping a detailed
        enemy in combat, or comprising a smaller encounter meant to simply wear
        down the player character's resources. They are designed to be dropped
        into an encounter with less planning required as compared to the
        detailed enemies, and are also designed to run through their turns
        quicker to keep combat flowing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary simplification is with Standard Rolls: each minion has a
        list of Standard Rolls for certain Abilities. Whenever the minion would
        need to make a Check, instead of rolling, just use the listed number as
        a proxy for the roll, adding any Adjustments as needed.
      </p>
      <h3>Minion Archetypes</h3>
      <p>
        Minions are organized by the roles they play in battle. The exact form
        these enemies take can be chosen by the GM through description and
        customization. The archetypes listed here are meant only as a base from
        which the more fleshed out minions that will be used in combat can be
        made from.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, minions will be listed first by archetype, then by level, allowing
        the GM to choose combatants that fill the needed roles for certain
        situations and certain levels. The stat blocks for these minions will
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At the top: their Difficulty Rating, Maximum Health, Speed, and Energy
          if relevant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Below that: their Standard Defense Roil, which is generally their
          Standard Athletics Roll plus their Armor Adjustment; this will be the
          target number the players will be rolling against for normal Attacks
        </li>
        <li>
          Then: their Standard Resistance Rolls. These are their Resilience,
          Will, and Spirit Standard Rolls, which are the most often to be used
          in Saves.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then: any other Standard Rolls they may have. Note that if any are not
          listed, count them as threes. If you're curious why, these scores are
          based on the Take Score Option.
        </li>
        <li>Then: any Resistances, Vulnerabilities, or Immunities they have</li>
        <li>
          In the section below that: all notable Actions they have. For Attacks,
          their Standard Hit Roll (Hit) and Standard Damage Roll (Dmg) are
          listed. For ranged attacks, a range in meters is also specified.
        </li>
        <li>In the last section: a list of Feats the character has.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For some stats will list an equation instead of a number, for
        <a href="#custom">customization</a>
        purposes. If this is the case, the number after the "=" is the stat's
        actual value.
      </p>
      <p class="warn">
        Moving these stat blocks over from the document is a work in progress.
        They're just not playing nice with the format change.
      </p>

      <h3 id="custom">Customizing Minions</h3>
      <p>
        While the listed archetypes should give a good roster of generic
        enemies, it's good to customize them for specific enemies. For example,
        if you're running an encounter with fire spirits, you may want to add
        resistance to fire as one of their traits. While customizing a minion,
        you may choose to give them higher Standard Rolls and Feats. For adding
        Feats, simply add the Feat's Skill Point cost to the minion's Difficulty
        Rating. As for Standard Rolls, the minion's Difficulty Rating will
        increase by one when its Standard Rolls increase by a total of three.
      </p>
      <p class="no-indent">
        When you increase a minion's Standard Rolls, you may have to update its
        other stats:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Maximum Health:</strong> A minion's Maximum Health increases
          one point for every point its <strong>Resilience</strong>,
          <strong>Will</strong>, and <strong>Spirit</strong> Standard Rolls
          increase.
        </li>
        <li>
          Speed: A minion's Speed increases one point for every two points its
          Athletics Standard Roll increases. In general, this value should be
          half the Athletics Standard Roll (rounded down), plus eight.
        </li>
        <li>
          Defense: A minion's Defense increases one point for every point its
          Athletics Standard Roll increases. If adding Heavy Armor, the effect
          of Athletics is halved.
        </li>
        <li>
          Attacks: A minion's Hit and Damage for each of its Attacks will
          increase by one point for every point the specified Ability Standard
          Roll increases. If no Ability is specified, use Dexterity for Hit and
          Ranged Damage, and Strength for Melee Damage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example, if you grant a minion the Redirection Feat, +2 to its
        Standard Strength Roll, and +1 to its Standard Will Roll, this will
        increase its Difficulty Rating by four. Three for the Redirection Feat,
        and one for the three points on its Standard Rolls. Its Maximum Health
        would also increase by 1, due to the increased Standard Will Roll.
      </p>
      <p>
        When choosing stats for attacks and armor, pick items from the Equipment
        section, even if they represent something other than literal items. For
        example, you may give the minion a flamethrower to represent fire
        breath. For every 50 Credits spent on Equipment, add 1 to the minion's
        Difficulty Rating. You may also upgrade its attacks using the Legendary
        Weapon Upgrades, adding 2 to the Difficulty Rating for each Legendary
        Weapon Point.
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, feel free to create new Weapons, Upgrades, Feats, etc., as
        long as you choose costs that are balanced when compared to the other
        options in those categories.
      </p>
      <h4>Stats listed with an equation</h4>
      <p>
        Some stats in a stat block will be listed as an equation instead of a
        number. In this case, when upgrading the stat, you will be upgrading the
        <u>underlined</u> number, and the actual stat will be determined by the
        expression on the left of the &ldquo;=&rdquo;. This is mostly meant to
        be used for minions with Heavy Armor, which halves the Athletics
        Standard Roll on all stats that depend on it.
      </p>
      <h4>Creating archetypes from scratch</h4>
      <p>
        Below is an example of a minion with no points spent on its difficulty.
        Note that all Standard Rolls start at 3, this is why stat blocks have an
        assumed value of three when a stat is not listed. The health of 9 is the
        sum of the Resilience, Will, and Spirit scores with no further
        modification. The speed is the Athletics Standard Roll (3), -3 to get
        the underlying score, and then put through the normal character speed
        calculation of Athletics/2 + 8. Defense is the Athletics Standard Roll
        without Armor. The Attack uses the Dexterity and Strength Standard Rolls
        for Hit and Damage respectively, with no modification that a weapon
        would provide.

      <h2 id="enemy-feats">Enemy-only Feats</h2>
      <p>
        There are some Feats that can only be taken by enemies, mostly for
        balance reasons. These cover everything from simple stat adjustment, to
        powerful abilities.
      </p>
      <h3>Stat Adjustments</h3>
      <p>
        These Feats exist to make small adjustments to enemy stats without
        changing their Standard Rolls. Some of these Feats have a negative Skill
        Point cost, as they make the enemy weaker.
      </p>
      <h4>Health Increase</h4>
      <p class="no-indent">
        <em>1 Skill Point, can be taken multiple times</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some enemies should stick in the combat longer than their Standard Rolls
        would suggest. Each time a character takes this Feat, their Maximum
        Health is increased by five.
      </p>
      <h4>Health Reduction</h4>
      <p class="no-indent">
        <em>-1 Skill Point, can be taken multiple times</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some enemies should just go down quickly. Each time a character takes
        this Feat, their Maximum Health is reduced by five. If this Feat would
        reduce their Maximum Health below one, it instead sets it to one. This
        Feat cannot be taken by a character with only one Maximum Health.
      </p>
      <h4>Speed Increase</h4>
      <p class="no-indent">
        <em>1 Skill Point, can be taken multiple times</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some enemies should move faster than their Standard Athletics Roll would
        suggest. Each time a character takes this Feat, their Speed increases by
        two,
      </p>
      <h4>Speed Reduction</h4>
      <p class="no-indent">
        <em>-1 Skill Point, can be taken multiple times</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some enemies should not move as quickly as their Standard Athletics Roll
        would suggest Each time a character takes this Feat, their Speed is
        reduced by two. If this Feat would reduce their Speed below zero, it
        instead sets it to zero. This Feat cannot be taken by a character with
        zero Speed.
      </p>
      <h3>Other Feats</h3>
      <h4>Damage Immunity</h4>
      <p class="no-indent">
        <em>4 Skill Points, can be taken multiple times</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose one
        <a href="additional.html#damage-type">Damage Type</a>. The character
        gains Immunity to all Damage of that type. If you choose an Elemental
        Damage Type, you may only choose one Element per time this Feat is
        taken.
      </p>
      <h4>Damage Vulnerability</h4>
      <p class="no-indent">
        <em>-2 Skill Points, can be taken multiple times</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose one
        <a href="additional.html#damage-type">Damage Type</a>. The character
        gains Vulnerability to all Damage of that type. If you choose an
        Elemental Damage Type, you may only choose one Element per time this
        Feat is taken.
      </p>
      <h4>Powerful Natural Weapons</h4>
      <p class="no-indent">
        <em>0 Skill Points, can be taken multiple times</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As enemies use Weapons and Armor to represent their Attacks and Defense,
        regardless of whether or not the Attack actually uses an item, this Feat
        converts an item to an ingrained part of the enemy. Choose an item. The
        character always has that item equipped and cannot be disarmed of it.
      </p>
      <h4>Status Immunity</h4>
      <p class="no-indent">
        <em>2 Skill Points, can be taken multiple times</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose one
        <a href="a.html">Status Effect</a>. The character is unable to be
        affected by that Status Effect.
