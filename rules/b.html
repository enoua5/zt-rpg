      <h1>Appendix B — Equipment</h1>
      <p>
        Equipment covers everything from your character's money, to their
        weapons and armor, to the various items they could carry around with
        them. This system does not impose strict carry limits, though the GM may
        rule what can and cannot be carried on a case-by-case basis. As a
        general rule of thumb, only 10-20 important items should be in your
        inventory at a time. Only two hand-held items can be used at a time.
      </p>
      <h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout the world, there may be different currencies issued by
        different states and organizations. To avoid having players track how
        much wealth they have in each specific type of currency, a standardized
        unit is used: the Credit. Depending on the specific setting, there may
        or may not be a standard currency in-universe that acts as Credits, but
        it's assumed that currency can be exchanged easily enough to express in
        these more abstract units. One Credit is standardized to be worth about
        the price of a meal in an average restaurant, regardless of inflation or
        actual price in local currency.
      </p>
      <h2>Meals and Rations</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout an adventure, you will need to eat in order to avoid
        <a href="a.html#hunger">Hunger</a>. This is done through expending Meals
        and Rations. These two items serve the same function, the only
        difference being that Rations can be placed into your inventory and
        never perish, while Meals must be consumed within a day of creation. In
        normal circumstances, Meals cost 1 Credit each, and Rations cost 2.
        Eating more than one Meal or Ration at a time provides no additional
        benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, you will need to eat twice per day to get the full benefits
        of
        <a href="additional.html#resting">Rest</a>. The most efficient places to
        do so are directly before and after Sleep. Eating in the morning will
        allow you to avoid taking the -5 penalty to Rests throughout the day.
        Eating before Sleep will allow you to gain the full benefits of that
        Sleep. Refer to the rules on
        <a href="additional.html#resting">Rest</a>
        and
        <a href="a.html#hunger">Hunger</a>
        for specifics.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to buying Meals and Rations from a shop for Credits, Meals
        can be obtained through hunting/foraging, and Rations can be obtained
        through preserving Meals. Both actions require about an hour of work in
        typical circumstances, and may require a Check if the relevant resources
        are scarce. In extremely scarce environments, the GM may make finding
        food into a full scene in and of itself.
      </p>
      <h2>Armor</h2>
      <p>
        Any Armor you wear will grant you an Adjustment to Athletics Saves
        against Attacks, There are two types of Armor: Light and Heavy. Light
        Armor gives an Adjustment in the range of +1 to +6. The Heavy Armor
        gives an Adjustment in the range from +3 to +12, however, you have one
        Removed Die when making Athletics Checks and Saves while wearing Heavy
        Armor. Only one set of armor may be worn at a time.

      <h3>Shields</h3>
      <p>
        Shields provide the same Adjustment of Light Armor of the same cost as
        long as the shield is actively being held. For instance, a 30-credit
        shield provides a +3 Adjustment to Defense Saves when held.
      </p>
      <h2>Weapons</h2>
      <p>
        Weapons can grant Adjustments to Hit and Damage Checks, as well as grant
        various special abilities. Most weapons will use Dexterity as the Hit
        Attribute. Most striking weapons use Strength for the Damage Attribute,
        and ranged weapons usually use Dexterity. The Adjustments range from +0
        to +6, and usually only apply to Hit <em>or</em> Damage Checks.
        Adjustments listed here as "&mdash;" are treated as +0. They are listed
        differently because "+0" stats can be upgraded, while "&mdash;" stats
        cannot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Break Chance refers to an item's fragility when a Check made to use it
        is Critically Failed. If the Hit Check is the minimum possible for the
        dice being used, the player must make a Break Save for the weapon: roll
        1d100 and if the result is less than or equal to the Break Chance, the
        weapon breaks, and cannot be used again until it is repaired.
      </p>
      <h3>Weapon Properties</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Area of Effect (AoE) - </strong>Attacks made with the weapon
        target all chosen targets within a radius of the specified AoE range;
        i.e., the targeted space and all spaces reachable within the range
        distance. One Attack Check is made, but all targets make Defense Saves.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Area of Effect - All (AoE-A) -</strong> Similar to AoE, but
        simply targets all within the AoE range, even if the wielder doesn't
        want to.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Damage Type - </strong>Weapon deals damage of the specified type
        instead of Standard Damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reload - </strong>This weapon can only be used once per round,
        even if a Feat would otherwise allow multiple uses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Single-Use - </strong>The weapon can only be used once for an
        attack, after which it breaks and cannot be fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Two-Handed - </strong>You can not use any other items requiring
        hand-usage while using this item.

      <h3>Legendary Weapons</h3>
      <p>
        Just as the characters gain skill and renown as the campaign goes on, so
        too do their weapons. Any time a weapon is used to strike the final blow
        on a noteworthy foe, or when it is used in a particularly interesting
        way, the GM may reward that weapon a Legendary Weapon Point. These
        points can be spent on upgrades within this table to add special
        abilities and improvements to that particular weapon. Legendary Weapon
        Points cannot be transferred between weapons. Upgrades cannot be applied
        more than once, unless otherwise stated.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not impossible to find Legendary Weapons up for sale, but it's
        uncommon and generally expensive, as they tend to be well-known in their
        own right.
