        Note: this is one of the more complicated magic systems in the game. You

        you use it.
      </p>
      <h3>In-Universe Explanation</h3>
      <p>
        Elemental Magic is the art of channeling Energy to influence the
        Elements. It's a form of magic that is accessible to all life, and there
        are examples of not only animals, but also plants and the occasional
        species of germ capable of harnessing its power, though to a lesser
        extent than to humans and dragons. There are
        <a href="#twelve-elements">Twelve Elements</a>, and corresponding Twelve
        Energies. These Elements are sorted into the Four Aspects, with three
        Elements within each Aspect. Each Aspect is described by one of two
        positions within the two Alignment Axes. These Alignment Axes are
        Chaotic-Orderly and Constructive-Destructive, and together indicate how
        the Element generally interacts with the world. The Chaotic-Orderly Axis
        details how the Element acts alone: Chaotic Elements are associated with
        change, dynamacy, and unpredictability, while stable elements are
        associated with permanence, staticness, and predictability. The
        Construction-Destruction Alignment details how the element interacts
        with the world: Constructing Elements create new structure, whereas
        destroying elements tear things down for new things to take their place.
        Each Element also has an Anti-Element, one of the Elements in the Aspect
        with opposite Alignment. In a sense, the Energies of Elements and
        Anti-Elements are the same, only negatives of each other.
      </p>
      <h3>Basic Mechanics</h3>
      <h4>New Actions</h4>
      <p class="no-indent">You gain the following choices for Major Actions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cast Elemental Magic:</strong> You can cast 1 Elemental Spell,
          as described the the section
          <a href="#casting-magic">Casting Magic</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="no-indent">You gain the following choices for Minor Actions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintain Spell:</strong> If you cast a Spell with an Effect
          using the "Maintain" Duration, you can use this Action to keep the
          Effects of that one Spell active until the end of your next turn
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Switch Energy Types:</strong> You can only use Energy of one
          Element at a time (unless you have a Feat allowing otherwise). Use
          this Action to change which type you currently have access to. This
          Action immediately ends any Maintained Spells of a Energy Type you are
          no longer using.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="casting-magic">Casting Magic</h4>
      <p>
        With Elemental Magic, there is no set list of Spells. Instead, players
        create their own Spells based on certain rules. Since it can take some
        time to piece together a Spell, it's recommended that, outside of game
        sessions, you write down a few that you might use often, alongside their
        Energy Costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Elemental Spell consists of one or more Effects, and each Effect
        consists of three components: one or more Effects, a Duration, and a
        Target. Each component costs some amount of Energy. When you Cast the
        Spell, add up the Energy Costs for each Effect, then add the Energy
        Costs for each Effect to get the total Energy Cost for the Spell.
        Subtract that from your Energy Pool upon Casting. You may also use your
        own Hit Points as Energy for this purpose if you so desire, spending 2
        Hit Points to act as 1 Energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have an Energy Limit equal to your Spirit Score. If you cast a Spell
        costing more than your Energy Limit, you must make a Spirit Check with a
        Difficulty equal to the amount you exceeded the Limit by. If you fail
        the Check, you fail to Cast the Spell. Your Energy is spent regardless
        of the success of the Spell.
      </p>
      <h5>Effects</h5>
      <p>
        Elemental Magic can create/destroy nonliving matter, move matter, or
        shape matter. Certain Elements may have other Effects they're capable
        of. There are 12 Elements, each with their own properties and
        difficulties in using. Keep in mind that you can only use one type of
        Elemental Magic at a time unless you have a Feat allowing otherwise. For
        example, if you currently have Fire Energy attuned, you can only work
        with Fire, and not any other Element. It takes a Minor Action to switch
        Energy Types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Spell has one or more Effects, and each Effect its own Duration and
        Target. Since Effects are a lot more complicated than the other
        Components due to differences between Elements, their usage is described
        in another section,
        <a href="#twelve-elements">The Twelve Elements</a>.
      </p>
      <h5>Duration</h5>
      <p>
        This is how long an Effect lasts. When Effects end, they usually either
        stop imposing a force on the subject, or the subject returns to its
        natural pre-Effect state, depending on the exact context of the Effect
        and the GM's decision.
      </p>
      <p class="no-indent">
        Pick one of the following Durations per each Effect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Instantaneous (0 Energy):</strong> The Spell occurs
          immediately and then fades out. This can only be used for
          Instantaneous Effects
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Timed (1 Energy per Round):</strong> The spell continues until
          the specified time elapses. If in Combat, the Round Counter increments
          whenever the Caster's Turn starts. For example, if 1 Energy is spent
          to make the spell last 1 round, the Spell will end at the start of the
          Caster's next Turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintained (2 Energy):</strong> The Spell continues
          indefinitely, until the Caster stops maintaining it. As maintaining a
          Spell is a Minor Action, there are many things you cannot do without
          ending the spell. If you are maintaining a Spell and you take damage,
          you must succeed a Spirit Save against the damage taken or the Spell
          immediately ends.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Targets</h5>
      <p>
        A Target specifies where an Effect hits. There are two main categories
        of Target: Internal and External. External Targets target empty space or
        nonliving matter, whereas Internal Targets target living things. Any
        Effect that has a direct effect on a soul or on a living body, can only
        be used with Internal Targeting. If you attempt to hit a character using
        External Targeting (by moving something into their space, such as by
        launching a fireball), they may attempt to nullify the effect against
        them by making an appropriate Save contested against a Spirit Check by
        the Caster. Damage Checks against Internal Targets are made with
        Adjustment +3.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also Melee and Ranged Targets. Melee Targets must be within
        the Caster's normal Melee Range. Ranged Targets must be within a number
        of meters equal to twice the Caster's Spirit Score.
      </p>
      <p class="no-indent">
        Pick one or more of the following Targets per each Effect
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Self (Internal, Melee, 0 Energy):</strong> Targets only the
          Caster.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Willing (Internal, Ranged, 2 Energy):</strong> Targets any
          character that is willing to have the Effect Cast on them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unwilling (Internal, Ranged, 4 Energy):</strong> Targets any
          character. They can try to resist the Spell by making a Will Save
          against a Spirit Check from the Caster.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Touch (External, Melee, 1 Energy):</strong> The Effect takes
          place somewhere the Caster is touching.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ranged (External, Ranged, 2 Energy):</strong> The Effects
          takes place in an unoccupied space of the Caster's choice within
          range.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="twelve-elements">The Twelve Elements</h3>
      <p>
        The following is a list of all the Elements in ZT, organized by
        Alignment. Each Element's section begins with a brief description of
        what that element covers, as well as what its Anti-Element is. Below
        that information are the Elements' available Effects, which you can
        choose from when choosing the Effects for a Spell using that Element.
      </p>
      <p>
        An Effect can be Instantaneous, Continuous, or Repeated. Instantaneous
        Effects occur only when the Spell starts (such as a loud bang, or an
        attack), Continuous Effects occur while the Spell is active (such as a
        light, or a region where speed is reduced), and Repeated Effects occur
        at the end of each of the Caster's Turns (such as repeated damage). Each
        Effect listed here will have "I", "C", and/or "R" (for "Instantaneous",
        "Continuous", and "Repeated", respectively) in brackets to show which
        types that Effect can be used as. Instantaneous Effects can only be used
        with Instantaneous Durations, while the other two types can be used only
        with the other two Durations.
      </p>
      <h4 id="emu">Elemental Matter Unit (EMU)</h4>
      <p>
        Many Effects scale by the amount of matter targeted. Here, a unit of ⅛
        cubic meters (i.e., a cube with a side-length of half a meter) is used
        for its more practical size. When only 2D space matters, such as for
        targeting an area of a battlefield, the unit is instead 1 square meter
        (i.e., 1 space). Both of these units will be referred to as an
        <strong>Elemental Matter Unit (EMU)</strong> in this section.
      </p>
      <h4>Common Effects</h4>
      <p>
        While most Elements have unique Effects to choose from, there are some
        Effects available to most Elements, only at different Energy Costs. Note
        that if one of these common Effects is not listed under an Element, the
        Effect cannot do that particular thing with that Element. To avoid
        listing those repeatedly, here are the common Effects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Movement [ICR]:</strong> A distance is listed. For each point
          of Energy spent on this Effect, the Caster can move 1 EMU of the
          Element that distance in one Round. More Energy can be spent to move
          the Element further/faster, or to move more of the Element. If the
          matter being moved is attached to something, the GM may require more
          Energy and/or a Spirit Check to successfully move it. If using C-Type,
          there are further costs each round to change the direction or
          velocity, though the object will, without Energy or Actions, continue
          on its current path until out of the Caster's range. If using R-Type,
          the object remains stationary after it's moved, and the Caster may
          choose to move it again using half the cost of Movement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Forming [IC]:</strong> Specifies how hard it is to make
          intricate shapes using the Element. One of the following difficulties
          is listed: Trivial, Easy, Moderate, or Hard. When forming matter into
          a particular shape, the GM decides the shape's complexity between the
          following: Rough, Defined, Complex, and Intricate. Use the table below
          to match the difficulty and complexity to a Energy Cost for the
          Forming Effect per EMU. If using I-Type, the shape is held
          indefinitely, whereas with C-Type, the shape is lost when the spell
          ends. Note that some Elements only allow I-Type or C-Type forming, and
          not always both.

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Healing [IR]:</strong> <em>1 Energy/Hit Point.</em> You can

          Component.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protection [C]:</strong> <em>2 Energy.</em> You can grant an
          Internal Target Resistance to all damage for the duration.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shunt [C]: </strong><em>5 Energy</em>. Dislodge a Soul from
          its body. While the Soul is displaced, Spirit Saves are treated as if
          the dice part of the check resulted in a zero. The Soul returns
          instantly when the spell ends.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>New Life [I]:</strong> <em>80 Energy.</em> Create a Soul. A

      <p>
        In addition to visible light, Light includes the entire spectrum. Also
        note that Light magic can't make things darker, Darkness is a separate
        Element.
      </p>
      <ul>

            >Dim light: 1 Energy/meter radius, Bright light: 2 Energy/meter
            radius.</em
          >
          Cast light of the specified brightness over the specified radius. If
          an area is already dimly lit, adding dim light with this Effect is
          enough to create bright light.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Movement:</strong> <em>50 meters.</em> If you created a
          free-floating lightsource, you can move it up to 50 meters for 1
          Energy, regardless of its brightness and range. If you cast Illuminate
          targeting an object (ie, lighting that object), there's no need to use
          magic to move it.

        Fire magic covers things such as flame and heat. When making flames,
        remember that fire spreads: you probably don't need much Energy to
        create a blaze unless you're low on time or fuel.
        <a href="additional.html#fire">Fire spreads and deals damage</a>
        on its own, without input from the Caster.

        <li><strong>Forming [C]:</strong> <em>Hard</em></li>
        <li>
          <strong>Movement:</strong> <em>8 meters.</em> You can move multiple
          Units of fire into the same space to create a hotter fire, combining
          the EMUs. Conversely, if a space has a flame with more than 1 EMU, you
          can split the flame into multiple parts with the same
          <em>total</em> EMU.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Extinguish [i]:</strong> <em>1 Energy/EMU</em>. Decrease a
          flame's EMU value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spark [I]:</strong> <em>1 Energy</em>. Create a small spark,
          just able to start a fire with kindling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heat [IC]:</strong> <em>warm: 1 Energy, hot: 2 Energy</em>.
          Heat 1 EMU of material. This doesn't get material hot enough to
          inflict Damage, unless the GM rules otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flame [I]:</strong> <em>3 Energy/EMU</em>. Create a flame. If
          you target an existing flame, or put multiple levels of this Effect
          into the same spot, then the resulting flame receives the combined
          EMUs put upon it.

        <strong>Anti-Element:</strong>
        <a href="#magnetism">Magnetism</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Lightning is the element of the lightning that strikes from the sky as
        well as the electricity we use to power much technology.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Strike [I]:</strong> <em>3 Energy.</em> Make a Spirit Check
          with an Adjustment of 5 and deal the result as Damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Power [C]:</strong> <em>1+ Energy.</em> Power an electric
          device. A small, simple device, such as one that usually runs on
          battery can be powered with 1 Energy. A larger, more complex device,

        <li>
          <strong>Extra Time [I]:</strong>
          <em>3 Energy, Internal Targeting only.</em> Grant the Target an extra
          Major Action, <em>or</em> cause the Target to lose their choice (not
          the Caster's) of Major or Minor Action.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stretch Time [C]:</strong> <em>1 Energy/EMU.</em> The Caster
          chooses either "faster" or "slower". If faster, the Targeted area is
          moved through for half the usual movement cost. If slower, the
          Targeted area is moved through for twice the usual movement cost.
        </li>

          <strong>Desync [I]:</strong>
          <em>5 Energy, Internal Targeting Only</em>. Cause the Target's body to
          desync with itself. Make a Spirit Check and deal the result as Damage.
          The Target must make a Resilience Save with a Difficulty equal to the
          Damage dealt. If the Target fails this Save, it falls Unconscious.

          of the device. Something like a simple communicator or camera only
          take 1 Energy, something like a standard computer takes 3 Energy, and

      <h3>In-Universe Explanation</h3>
      <p>
        Potion Brewing is the art of combining various ingredients to produce
        magical effects for those who drink it. Certain plants are known for
        their value in creating simple potions, but more complex potions require
        increasingly rarer ingredients and greater skill.
      </p>
      <h3>Basic Mechanics</h3>
      <p>
        Potion brewing starts with a pot of water over fire. Adding specific
        ingredients will create specific potions, and adding more ingredients to
        those potions will alter the effects. Potion brewing will also take
        several hours and require either a Knowledge or Logic Check.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each brewing creates one dose of a Potion by default, and drinking that
        dose will grant the drinker the effects as stated. If the drinker
        doesn't want the effect, they can make a Resilience Check with a
        Difficulty decided by the GM to nullify the effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of having a predefined potion tree, a minimal tree is provided.
        This minimal tree will be the same between all ZT games, but beyond
        there can end up wildly different. What makes a fire-breathing potion in
        one world might make a poison in another. The mechanics of this will be
        explained below, but first, the standard tree:

      <h4>Brewing a Known Potion</h4>
      <p>
        All potions in the diagram above are considered Known Potions, as well
        as any Potions the character has either made before, or has a recipe
        for. All Known Potions are organized into a tree as shown in the
        diagram. Starting either from water, or from a Potion the character has,
        follow the tree down to the desired Potion, summing all ingredients,
        times, and Difficulties. These will become the required components of
        the desired potion. For example, to brew a Resilience Potion, a
        character will use Potioneer's Wax and Sage Root, the potion will take
        an hour and a half to brew, and the player must make a Difficulty 5
        Knowledge Check. However, if the character already has Thick Potion,
        they can make Resilience Potion using only Sage Root, an hour of
        brewing, and a Difficulty 4 Knowledge Check.
      </p>
      <h4>Discovering New Potions</h4>
      <p>
        Starting from a Potion the character has (water counts as a Potion for
        this purpose), the character can add a new ingredient to that Potion and
        start it on the fire. The GM is free to decide the brewing duration,
        Difficulty, and the effect of the resulting potion, which are each used
        as they would be in brewing a Known Potion. When choosing duration and
        Difficulty, remember that they're in reference to brewing it from an
        existing Potion, not from water, so go with lower numbers. For effects,
        keep the effect related to the previous effect: you can change the
        potency, duration, negate the effect, or simply go with something that
        has a similar "vibe", it's up to the GM.
      </p>
      <p>
        If successful, the character will know when the duration has passed, as
        the Potion will visibly change, however, they won't know what effect it
        will have until after they drink it. Once a New Potion is successfully
        made, it is added to the tree of Known Potions, under the Potion that
        was used to brew it, noting the ingredient, duration, and Difficulty,
        and effect. It is the GM's responsibility to keep this list.
      </p>
      <h4>Failed Potion</h4>
      <p>
        If the character fails a check to make a Potion, they end up with a
        Failed Potion. While most Failed Potions simply have no effect upon
        consumption, they can have any effect whatsoever, usually related to the
        intended effect. It's the GM's choice what a Failed Potion does, and
        there is no expectation for the Failed Potion effects to be predictable
        nor consistent.
      </p>
      <h3>Feats</h3>
      <h4>Multiple Dose Batch</h4>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You're skilled at managing large batches of Potion. When Brewing, you
        may brew multiple doses at once by multiplying the required ingredients
        by the same amount (i.e., 3 doses takes 3 of each ingredient). The
        brewing time and Difficulty are unaffected.
      </p>
      <h4>Potioneer's Intuition</h4>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You've learned some of the underlying mechanics of how ingredients
        interact. You may make Logic Checks to determine what effect a
        particular ingredient would have on a Potion, or what ingredients might
        get you closer to a desired effect. The GM should provide you with
        information accurate and detailed enough for the total that was rolled.

        character's stats. Make sure to keep track of your non-shifted stats
        separately!
      </p>
      <h3>In-Universe Explanation</h3>
      <p>
        A spirit naturally protects its body and resists outside influence.
        However, some have learned to "convince" their spirit that their body
        needs to be "corrected" to a different form. With the help of elemental
        energy, their bodies can be reshaped into these other forms.
      </p>
      <h3>Basic Mechanics</h3>
      <p>
        The basic building block of shape-shifting mechanically is the Temporary
        Skill Point (TSP). These can be spent on Abilities, and later Feats,
        with restrictions. After a specified length of time, TSPs are lost and
        all stats modified using them are reverted to normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gaining these TSPs requires the use of Energy. You have an Energy Limit
        equal to your Spirit Score. You can spend Energy up to your Energy Limit
        on a single Action with no Check. Spending more Energy requires a Spirit
        Check with Difficulty equal to the amount by which your Energy Limit was
        exceeded.
      </p>
      <h4>New Actions</h4>
      <p class="no-indent">You gain the following choices for Major Actions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Augment:</strong> Choose a number of TSPs less than or equal
          to half your Spirit Score, and a Duration up to a number of Rounds
          equal to your Spirit Score. The Energy Cost to gain the TSPs for the
          Duration is equal to the number of TSPs multiplied by the number of
          Rounds. These TSPs can only be spent on Abilities in the Body
          Category. You can make small changes to your physical appearance, but
          you're still recognizable as you. This Action cannot be used again
          until either the Duration is up, or the Revert Action is taken.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="no-indent">You gain the following choices for Minor Actions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Revert:</strong> Immediately discard all TSPs and revert to
          your normal form.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Feats</h3>
      <h4>Reformation</h4>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>Make the following changes to the Augment Action:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may now spend TSPs on Feats from the Body section of the
          <a href="#feats-by-category">Feats Organized by Category</a>
          list.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may now "sell" points from your Body Ability Scores for TSPs.
          Three points are required per TSP. Feats from the Body section of the
          <a href="#feats-by-category">Feats Organized by Category</a>
          list can also be sold for their cost, as long as losing them does not
          break a prerequisite for another Feat you keep. There is no limit to
          the number of TSPs gained this way, though they still contribute to
          the Energy Cost.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may take on a completely new form, but only generically. For
          example, you can turn into a dog, even a specific breed of dog, but
          you can't look like the exact dog that an owner is looking for.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Mind is Matter</h4>
      <p class="no-indent">
        <em>2 Skill Points, requires Reformation Feat</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You have gained the ability to reform your mind to match your new forms.
      </p>
      <p>Make the following changes to the Augment Action:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may now spend TSPs on Abilities and Feats from the Mind Category,
          and sell Mind Scores and Feats for TSPs.
        </li>
        <li>The maximum duration is doubled, and the Energy Cost is halved.</li>
        <li>
          You may take on the form of a specific character, as long as you are
          keenly familiar with their appearance.
