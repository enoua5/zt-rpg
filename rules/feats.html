      <h2>Automatic Healing</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>3 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You are skilled at healing injuries as they occur using your Energy. As
        a
        <a href="combat.html#major-action">Major Reaction</a>
        to taking Damage, you may spend a number of Energy points up to the
        amount of Damage taken. For each Energy point spent, you gain one Hit
        Point.
      </p>
      <h2>Brawler</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You are skilled in unarmed combat. When using Unarmed Strike or
        Improvised Weapons, you gain a +1 Adjustment on Hit and Damage.
        Additionally, you can use the Grapple Action as a Minor Action or Minor
        Reaction directly after a successful Unarmed Strike, against the same
        Target.
      </p>
      <h2>Catlike Landing</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You know how to fall without getting too hurt. Any
        <a href="additional.html#falling">Fall Damage</a>
        you take is cut in half, rounded down.
      </p>
      <h2>Charming</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        Your natural charisma can cause people to do things they would normally
        never do. Once per day, you may spend 1 hour planting an idea into
        someone's head. You can then make a Persuasion Check with a +4
        Adjustment to convince them of the idea for 24 hours. The GM may still
        grant the target an Adjustment to their Insight Save depending on the
        scale of the idea.
      </p>
      <h2>Climber</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You are a master of scaling vertical surfaces. Any surface you would
        normally be able to climb, you may climb at your full Speed. You can
        climb rough otherwise-unclimbable surfaces at half your Speed. You still
        may not climb very smooth surfaces.
      </p>
      <h2>Cover Cognizance</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You are very aware of your surroundings and know how to use them
        effectively. You may use a Major Action to increase your
        <a href="additional.html#cover">Cover</a>, from no Cover to Partial
        Cover, or from Partial Cover to Complete Cover. This effect ends if you
        take the Movement Action or are forced to move. When making Attacks
        under this increased Cover, you may still treat the Cover as its natural
        amount. For example, if you use this ability while hiding behind Partial
        Cover, you will not be able to be directly Targeted as if under Complete
        Cover, but you will be able to Target your opponents with the -3
        Adjustment to hit from the Partial Cover.
      </p>
      <h2>Crafter</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You are skilled with your hands, and even more skilled with the right
        tools. Given enough time and the right materials you can make and repair
        high quality items. You will need materials worth approximately half the
        value of the item you are crafting, and an amount of time as determined
        by the GM. The GM may have you make a Dexterity, Logic, or similar Check
        if you are working on a particularly difficult project.
      </p>
      <h2>Cut-Throat</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>3 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You know how to kill quickly. When you make a Melee Attack against a
        creature that is Incapacitated, use twice as many dice as you would
        normally.
      </p>
      <h2>Dark-Vision</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You can see in the dark. You do not receive the Blinded effect while in
        dark areas, unless the dark area was created via magic.
      </p>
      <h2>Deft Footwork</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You are skilled at maneuvering and forcing movement through the use of
        attacks. When you Hit with a Melee Attack, you may use a Minor Action to
        swap positions with the Target. This movement is not counted as forced,
        and thus can trigger Opportunity Attacks against both you and the
        Target.
      </p>
      <h2>Dual-Wielder</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You have mastered two-weapon combat. If you are holding two one-handed
        weapons, and you take the Attack action, you may attack twice, once with
        each weapon.
      </p>
      <h2 id="elemental-initiate">Elemental Initiate</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You have trained the art of channeling Energy through your Soul to
        influence the Elements. You gain the abilities detailed within the
        <a href="magic.html#elemental-magic">Elemental Magic</a>
        Section.
      </p>
      <h2>Evasion</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You are skilled in maneuvering around the battlefield. You may
        <a href="combat.html#disengage">Disengage</a>
        as a Minor Action.
      </p>
      <h2>Extra Sense</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You have the ability to feel that which is hidden. You are aware of the
        locations of characters and magical artifacts within 5 meters as though
        you could see them, even if they are hidden from view or magically
        obscured. You may also attempt to perceive characters and magical
        artifacts from further away. To do so, using the "Take in Information"
        Minor action, choose a point you can see, and a radius in which to
        search. Make a Perception Check with a -1 Adjustment for every 50 meters
        the point is away from you, and a -1 Adjustment for every meter of
        radius you are searching. All hidden characters and magical artifacts
        must make a relevant save or become revealed to you as though you could
        see them.
      </p>
      <h2>Favorite Weapon</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You have a weapon that you have learned to finely use. Choose any one
        specific weapon (not a class of weapons). All Attack and Damage Checks
        you make with this weapon are made with Adjustment +4.
      </p>
      <h2>Flying</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>3 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        Whether by wings, jetpacks, or otherwise, you have the ability to fly.
        You gain a Flying Speed equal to your Base Speed.
      </p>
      <h2>Frightening</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You have a terrifying presence that you can leverage to keep opponents
        away. As a Major Action, choose up to five Targets you can see within 15
        meters of you. Make a Performance Check, and force each Target to make a
        Will Save. Any who fail to make the Save against your Check are Fearful.
        While Fearful, they cannot willingly move closer to you if they are
        within 15 meters of you, and must use their Movement to move away from
        you if they are within that distance. This movement cannot force them to
        move through obviously dangerous terrain, such as off a cliff, but can
        force them to provoke Opportunity Attacks. This effect lasts until the
        end of your next Turn, but can be repeated as a Minor Action against
        those already Fearful of you.
      </p>
      <h2>Grappler</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You are skilled in Grappling. You may use Strength Check to initiate a
        Grapple. You also gain Adjustment +3 on Checks made to start a grapple,
        and on Saves made to maintain a Grapple.
      </p>
      <h2>Healer</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You are skilled in the art of medicine. If you tend to a group while
        they are
        <a href="additional.html#resting">Resting</a>
        and you are not, you can make a Knowledge Check and add that value to
        their Rest Check for Healing.
      </p>
      <h2>Health Redistribution</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You can share your healing energy with those around you. When you Heal,
        you may choose to instead allocate any number of those Hit Points to a
        character within 5 meters of you.
      </p>
      <h2>Hearty</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You are especially hearty and able to take more damage than normal.
        Boost your Max Health by 10. Remember that this also boosts your Energy.
      </p>
      <h2>Heightened Focus</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You can enter a state of extreme focus, boosting your abilities beyond
        your normal skill. As a Free Action, choose one Ability Category: Body,
        Mind, or Presense. For the next hour, all checks you make using
        Abilities in that Category are made with a +4 Adjustment. When the focus
        ends, you immediately suffer one level of
        <a href="status-effects.html#fatigue">fatigue</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Improved Redirection</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point, requires Redirection</em></p>
      <p>
        Your Redirection ability can now be triggered when an ally within 1
        meter of you is missed by an Attack. You may also now use the ability to
        Target the original Attacker.
      </p>
      <h2>Inspiring</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You are an inspiration to your party, helping them achieve their best.
        You have a pool of Inspiration Points equal to your Performance Score.
        Before someone makes a Check, you can spend one or more Inspiration
        Points to help them. For each point you spend, they gain +1d4 to the
        roll. You regain your Inspiration Points upon completing a
        <a href="additional.html#resting">Rest</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Jack of All Trades</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You have a knack for intuiting things you have no training in. Any time

      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You can<a href="combat.html#movement"> jump</a> far further than the
        average person. You may jump without getting a head start. If you
        <em>do</em> get a head start, you may jump twice as far as you would
        otherwise be able to.

      <h2>Light Sleeper</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You retain some amount of awareness while Sleeping. While Sleeping, you

      </p>
      <h2>Natural Weapons</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        Claws, fangs, horns, whatever it may be, your body naturally has weapons
        built in. Your Unarmed Strikes gain +1 Hit Adjustment, and +1 Damage
        Adjustment. Since these weapons are part of your body, you cannot be
        disarmed of them.
      </p>
      <h2>Near-Death Fighter</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>

      <p>
        You know (at least the basics of) how to brew potions. You gain the
        abilities detailed within the
        <a href="magic.html#potion-brewing">Potion Brewing</a>
        section.
      </p>
      <h2>Precise Striker</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You know where to aim to deal the most damage efficiently. You may use

      </p>
      <h2>Provocation</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You have a battlefield presence that causes enemies to prioritize
        attacking you. As a Major Action, choose up to five Targets you can see
        within 15 meters. Make a Performance Check, and force each Target to
        make a Will Save. Any who fail to make the Save against your Check are

        a Target other than they are Provoked by. This effect lasts until the

        any that are already Provoked by you.

        You can enter a barbarian-esque rage, heightening your combat skills for
        a short time. As a Minor Action, you can enter into a Rage for one
        minute. During this time, you gain +5 to all Strength Checks you make,
        and you are Resistant to
        <a href="additional.html#standard-dmg">Standard Damage</a>, taking half
        the dealt Damage. However, you may not expend Energy, and if there is an
        enemy within the range of a weapon (Melee range if unarmed) you are
        holding, you must make an Attack. You may Rage once per Rest.
      </p>
      <h2>Ramming Attack</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You can charge at your enemies to make ramming attacks, pushing them
        around. If, directly before making a Melee Attack, you move at least two
        meters towards your Target, it is counted as a Ramming Attack. If the
        Attack Hits, you can choose to push the Target two meters away from you.

      <p class="no-indent"><em>3 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You are a master of causing enemies to misjudge attacks. When an Attack
        misses you, you may choose a new target for the attack within 1 meter of
        you. You may not target the original attacker with this ability. The new
        target must then make a Defense Save against the original Hit Check.
      </p>

      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        Choose one
        <a href="additional.html#damage-type">Damage Type</a>. You gain
        resistance to all Damage of that type. If you choose an Elemental Damage
        Type, you may only choose one Element. You may not choose Standard
        Damage.
      </p>
      <h2 id="shape-shifting">Shape-Shifting</h2>

        the abilities detailed in the

      <p>
        <em> </em>You hit with forceful blows, knocking enemies off their feet.
        If you make a Hit Check that exceeds the Target's Defense Roll by five
        or more, or if the Target got a Critical Failure, you can knock the
        target Prone. This only applies if the Target is of the same or smaller
        Size Class than you.
      </p>
      <h2>Sneak Attack</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You know how to use stealth to your advantage when attacking. When you
        make an Attack against a Target that is unaware of your position, it is
        counted as a Sneak Attack. When you make a successful Sneak Attack, you
        may either roll damage with twice the dice, or inflict one of the
        following Effects: Blinded, Deafened, Grappled, or Prone. Note that
        making an Attack reveals your position.
      </p>
      <h2>Split Shot</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>2 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        When making a Ranged Weapon Attack, you can additionally target up to
        two extra Targets within 3 meters of the primary Target. When doing so,

      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You prefer to focus your attacks on one enemy at a time. As a Major
        Action, choose a character you can see to become your Mark. For one
        minute, or until the Target is removed from combat, you remain aware of
        their location, and gain +3 Adjustments on Hit and Damage checks against
        them. Choosing a new Mark replaces the current Mark.
      </p>
      <h2>Team Attack</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You know how to exploit an enemy's split attention when fighting
        multiple foes. When you make an Attack, you gain +1 to Hit and +1 Damage
        per ally that has the Target in their Melee Range.
      </p>
      <h2>Tracker</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>

        You are a master of tracking trails. You gain Adjustment +4 on all
        Perception Checks to follow tracks.

      <h2>Unnatural Fortitude</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>4 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You are capable of pushing through situations wherein most people would
        collapse. Whenever you gain a level of
        <a href="status-effects.html#fatigue">Fatigue</a>, you can make a Resilience Check
        against four times the level of the Fatigue. If the Check succeeds, you
        may immediately remove that level of Fatigue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, while in combat, your Hit Point total can fall to and
        below zero without you falling
        <a href="status-effects.html#unconscious">Unconscious</a>. When combat ends, if you
        are at or below zero Hit Points, you immediately gain two levels of
        Fatigue and fall unconscious. You still die at the regular point.
      </p>
      <h2>Untrackable</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
        You are always careful to never leave a trace of your passing. Your
        tracks cannot be followed by natural means.
      </p>
      <h2>Vocal Mimicry</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>3 Skill Points</em></p>
      <p>
        You have heightened control of your voice. You can perfectly mimic any
        voice you have heard for more than 5 minutes. If it's been a long time
        since you heard the voice, you may need to make a Knowledge Check to
        remember it.
      </p>
      <h2>Warning</h2>
      <p class="no-indent"><em>1 Skill Point</em></p>
      <p>
