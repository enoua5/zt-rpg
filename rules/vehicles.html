      <h1>Appendix C — Vehicles</h1>
      <p>
        Vehicles are entities which can be Piloted by Characters. This can
        include typical vehicles such as cars and space-ships, but also includes
        mounts such as horses, and remote-controlled entities. Vehicles do not
        get their own turns in combat. To take Actions in combat, their Pilot
        must allocate their Actions to the Vehicle. That is, a Pilot can use
        their Movement to move the Vehicle, their Main Action to use the
        Vehicle's weapons, and likewise for any other actions the Vehicle may
        have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vehicles have their own stats that define them, similar to Characters.
        This includes Maximum Health, Hit Points, Ability Scores, Weapons,
        Armor, and Feats. There are two classes of Vehicle: Agile and Throttled.
        Agile Vehicles have a Speed, similar to Characters. Throttled Vehicles
        tend to be faster, but instead of having a Speed, they have a Max Speed,
        Acceleration, and Turn Speed.
      </p>
      <h2>Damage and Repair</h2>
      <p>
        Every vehicle has its own
        <a href="charcreate.html#max-hp">Max HP</a>
        and
        <a href="charcreate.html#hp">HP</a>.
        <a href="combat.html#attack">Damage</a>
        works similar to how it does with Characters. If a Vehicle is below zero
        Hit Points, it is inoperable and cannot be given Actions. Vehicles that
        are organic, or otherwise self-repairing can regain health on their own
        via
        <a href="additional.html#resting">Rest</a>. Vehicles that cannot
        self-heal require a Character to repair them. Repairing has the same
        requirements as Resting, but the Character can use a different relevant
        Ability for making the Heal Check. A Character cannot Rest while
        repairing, essentially allocating their Rest to the Vehicle as they do
        with Actions. If a Vehicle's Hit Points drop to the negative of its
        Maximum Health, it is destroyed and cannot be repaired.
      </p>
      <h2>Abilities</h2>
      <p>
        For each of the twelve Abilities, a Vehicle can have a Score, an
        Adjustment, or a Blank. When an Action is allocated to the Vehicle, or
        when the Vehicle is Targeted, these determine what is rolled for the
        Check. For an Ability with a Score, the Vehicle uses that Ability Score
        regardless of the Pilot's own. For an Ability with an Adjustment, the
        Vehicle uses the Pilot's Score, but adds an Adjustment to the Check. For
        an Ability with a Blank, the Vehicle will automatically fail any Checks
        that require it.
      </p>
      <h2>Movement</h2>
      <h3>Agile Vehicles</h3>
      <p>
        Agile Vehicles are those that are relatively low-speed and
        high-maneuverability. They have a Speed stat like a Character would
        have, though typically much faster. They can be allocated their Pilot's
        Movement, and can move exactly as a Character can.
      </p>
      <h3>Throttled Vehicles</h3>
      <p>
        Throttled Vehicles move significantly faster, and as such, cannot stop
        or turn anywhere near as rapidly as the Agile Vehicles. Instead of
        having a Speed, Throttled Vehicles have a Max Speed, Acceleration, and
        Turn Speed. When in combat, they also have a Current Speed, and will be
        pointed in one of the eight grid directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eight grid directions consist of the four cardinal grid directions
        and the diagonals between them. Each of these eight directions is called
        an Angle, and when you turn, you must turn to one of the two Angles that
        is closest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any number of times per Round, as part of Movement, the Pilot can turn
        the Vehicle. The Vehicle can be turned one Angle in either direction.
        Once a Vehicle has been turned, it must move forward before it can be
        turned again. Vehicle will have a Turn Speed of between 0 and 4, which
        determines the number of Angles away from where it started the Round it
        can be turned to at any point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once per turn, as part of a Movement, the Pilot can Accelerate or
        Decelerate. In doing so, they can add or subtract up to the Vehicle's
        Acceleration to the Current Speed. The Vehicle can only move directly
        forward in the direction it's facing, and must move
        <em>exactly</em> the distance of its Current Speed. A Throttled Vehicle
        that is inoperable must always decelerate until it reaches a Current
        Speed of zero.
      </p>
      <h4>Crashing</h4>
      <p>
        While an Agile Vehicle can always stop or turn before hitting an
        obstacle, this may not always be possible for a Throttled Vehicle. An
        obstacle has a stopping power, the amount of Current Speed it will take
        from a Vehicle before being pushed out of the way. The Vehicle will be
        stopped if the stopping power is greater than or equal to its Current
        Speed. For every 10 Current Speed taken, the obstacle deals 1d8 damage
        to both the Vehicle and to itself. So for instance, if a brick wall with
        100 stopping power is hit by a car with a Current Speed of 150, the car
        will be slowed to 50 Current Speed, and both it and the wall will take
        10d8 damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Occupants of the Vehicle are shielded from crashing damage as long as
        the Vehicle is operable. Any damage dealt beyond that threshold is dealt
        to the Vehicle and all occupants. For instance, if a car has 15 hp left,
        and takes 20 damage, the car will now be at -5 hp and all occupants will
        take 5 damage each.
      </p>
      <h4>High-Speed Chases</h4>
      <p>
        Often with Throttled Vehicles, the speeds involved would have the
        Vehicles leaving any reasonably sized battle maps within a round or two.
        To combat this, High-Speed Chases are treated differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        A High-Speed Chase is initiated when multiple Throttled Vehicles are in
        Combat, moving at roughly the same Speed and Direction. When this
        happens, we can have the battle map follow the chase to keep things
        contained. During High-Speed Chases, one of the cardinal directions must
        be chosen by the GM as the forward direction. This is because the
        forward-backward directions are treated differently from the
        side-to-side directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the start of every Round, a Standard Speed is set equal to the
        Players' Vehicle's Current Speed. All Vehicles have a Relative Speed,
        equal to their Current Speed minus the Standard Speed. Vehicles with a
        positive Relative Speed cannot move to any space behind them on any
        step, and Vehicles with a negative Relative Speed cannot move to any
        space ahead of them on any step.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with how Current Speed usually works, all Vehicles must move exactly
        a number of spaces forward or backward equal to their Relative Speed.
        However, during High-Speed Chases, Vehicles cannot change their Angle
        away from the forward Angle. Instead, they can move one space left or
        right. This sideways movement can be used a number of times equal to
        twice their Turn Speed.
