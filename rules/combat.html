      <h1>Combat</h1>
      <p>
        Fights are a frequent occurrence for the average hero. Most fights
        aren't sneak attacks, however; there's usually moments of tension,
        verbal exchanges, and posturing before an actual fight. The GM should
        allow the players to role-play these moments before Initiative is ever
        rolled.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, eventually the combat has to start. When any character uses a
        <a href="#major-action">Major Action</a>
        in the presence of a character hostile to them, that Action is resolved,
        then all other combatants must make Initiative Checks to determine the
        order of combat. If more than one character wishes to take the initial
        Major Action, they should all make a Contested Check, with the highest
        roller being granted the opportunity.
      </p>
      <h2>Initiative</h2>
      <p>
        An Initiative Check is an Ability Check using the player's choice of
        either Athletics or Perception. Initiative Order runs from the character
        who rolled the highest down to the lowest. The character whose Major
        Action initiated the fight is automatically placed first in the
        Initiative Order. However, the initiating Action counts as their Major
        Action for the first Round. If the Action that initiates the Combat
        targets a character hostile to them, the targeted character is
        automatically placed second in Initiative Order. If the targeted
        character is not hostile to them, the nearest hostile character to the
        initiator is placed second.
      </p>
      <p>
        While in initiative, assume that 5 seconds pass with each Round; 12
        Rounds for a minute.
      </p>
      <h2>On Your Turn</h2>
      <p>
        On your turn, you can use three Actions: 1 Major Action, 1 Minor Action,
        and 1 Movement Action. Any number of Free Actions can be made on a Turn.
        Any Action marked with an asterisk (*) can be used in Reaction to
        another character's Action, using your Action for the next round. For
        example, you can use an Assist/Disrupt Action during another character's
        Turn, but doing so will make it so that you don't get a Major Action
        during your next Turn.
      </p>
      <h3 id="major-action">Major Action</h3>
      <p>For your Major Action, choose one of the following Actions:</p>
      <h4 id="attack">Attack</h4>
      <p>
        Make an attack using a weapon. Improvised weapons (such as a rock, or
        lead pipe) and Unarmed Strikes count for this purpose). See
        <a href="equipment.html#weapon-list">Weapon List</a>
        for Unarmed Strike and Improvised Weapon stats. Attacks are resolved as
        follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Attacker chooses a Target within Range. Melee Attacks have a Range
          of 1 meter unless otherwise specified. Ranged weapons will specify a
          Range value and will allow you to attack any Target you can see within
          a number of meters equal to your weapon's Range. You may attack a
          Target at twice the normally allowed distance with an Adjustment of -3
          to Hit, regardless of if the Attack is Ranged or Melee. You may not
          attack a target further than this doubled range.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Attacker makes a Check using the weapon's Hit Attribute, adding
          its Hit Adjustment. If the Check is a Critical Fail, the weapon has a
          chance of breaking. If this happens, roll 1d100 against the weapon's
          Break Chance. If you roll higher than the chance, nothing happens. If
          you roll lower than or equal to the Break Chance, the weapon breaks,
          and must be repaired before being used again. If your weapon breaks,
          the Attack hits regardless of the Target's Save, and gains an
          Adjustment of +5 to Damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Target makes an Athletics Save, adding their Armor Adjustment. If
          the Attacker is using a Ranged attack within the Target's Melee Range,
          roll the Save with an Adjustment of +3.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the Target's Save is equal to or greater than the Attacker's Check,
          the Attack fails: exit this process. Otherwise, continue to step five.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Attacker now rolls Damage. Make a check using the weapon's Damage
          Attribute, adding its Damage Adjustment. Deduct the Damage from the
          target's HP.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Grapple</h4>
      <p>
        Make an unarmed melee attack against the target (see
        <a href="#attack">Attack</a>). Instead of doing damage, the target gains
        the <a href="status-effects.html#grappled">Grappled</a>
        status. The Grappler's speed is cut in half while Grappling unless the
        target is a smaller size class than the Grappler's. Characters can only
        Grapple one target at a time. A Grapple can be ended by the Grappler at
        any time as a Free Action. If at any point, the Grappler fails a Save
        made with an Ability in the Body Category, the Grapple ends immediately.
        The grappled character may attempt to struggle as a Major Action,
        putting the Grappler in a Strength or Dexterity Contest, which could
        count as the failed Save that ends the Grapple.
      </p>
      <h4>Assist/Disrupt*</h4>
      <p>
        As a Reaction to another combatant making a check, impose either +3 or
        -3 Adjustment on the Check.
      </p>
      <h4>Dash</h4>
      <p>Take an extra Movement Action.</p>
      <h4 id="disengage">Disengage</h4>
      <p>Become immune to Opportunity Attacks until the start of next Turn.</p>
      <h4>Extra Minor Action*</h4>
      <p>
        Take an extra Minor Action. This can also be used as a Reaction,
        allowing, for example, two Opportunity Attacks.
      </p>
      <h4>Major Action from a Feat</h4>
      <p>
        Many <a href="feats.html">Feats</a>
        provide new Major Actions to choose from.
      </p>
      <h4>Delay</h4>
      <p>
        You can take your turn after your slot in the Initiative if you'd like.
        Choose a trigger such as "when an ally gets attacked" or "after the
        dragon's turn", or whatever you'd like. When that trigger occurs, you
        may immediately use any Actions you have remaining from this turn. If
        your next Turn starts before the trigger occurs, you may finish this
        Turn before immediately starting your next Turn.
      </p>
      <h4>Improvised Major Action</h4>
      <p>
        On your Turn, you can still do things as though in role-play. The GM may
        rule that one of these attempted actions is long/complex enough to count
        as a Major Action.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you could attempt to wrestle a gun from an opponent's grip.
        The GM may rule that this would count as your Major Action for the
        round. If you agree to use your Major Action for this, the GM will have
        you roll a Check to see if you succeed.
      </p>
      <h3>Minor Action</h3>
      <p>For your Minor Action, choose one of the following Actions:</p>
      <h4>Opportunity Attack*</h4>
      <p>
        As a Reaction to a character moving from a space within your Melee Range
        to a space not within your Melee Range, you may use this Action to
        attack that character as though with the Attack Action.
      </p>
      <h4>Switch Held Item</h4>
      <p>
        Switch out the item you are holding for another item on your person, or
        pick up an item laying unguarded within 1 meter of you.
      </p>
      <h4>Take in Information*</h4>
      <p>
        Make a Perception, Knowledge, or Spirit Check to gather information that
        isn't readily apparent.
      </p>
      <h4>Minor Action from a Feat</h4>
      <p>
        Many <a href="feats.html">Feats</a>
        provide new Minor Actions to choose from.
      </p>
      <h4>Improvised Minor Action</h4>
      <p>
        On your Turn, you can still do things as though in role-play. The GM may
        rule that one of these attempted actions requires enough focus to count
        as a Minor Action.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you could say you open a chest. The GM could say that this
        would count as a Minor Action. You have the choice as to whether you go
        through with the action or not.
      </p>
      <h3 id="movement">Movement Action</h3>
      <p>
        Move a number of meters up to your Speed. On a standard battle grid, one
        square is one meter. Given a 2 meter running start, you may jump up to a
        distance equal to 2 + (your Athletics score / 2). Without a head start,
        you may jump half this distance. The distance traveled while jumping
        still counts towards your distance moved in the turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving through rough terrain, swimming, or climbing a rough surface
        effectively takes 2 meters of movement per meter actually moved. You
        cannot move through occupied spaces, solid objects, where there is
        nowhere to stand, or up smooth walls.
      </p>
      <h2>Unconsciousness and Death</h2>
      <p>
        If at any point, your HP drops to or below zero, you fall
        <a href="status-effects.html#unconscious">Unconscious</a>. Your HP total <em>can</em>
        drop below zero. If your HP reaches the negative of your Max HP, you are
        dead.
